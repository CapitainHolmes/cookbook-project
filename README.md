# ONLINE COOKBOOK - MILSTONE PROJECT 3
 
#### Data Centric Development Project

In this project, we were asked to create an online Cookbook in where users could find recipes that includes, the cuisine, steps needed 
to take in order to cook, ingredients they will need and the required tools. We are to use backend code and frontend form(s) to allow
users to add their own recipes to the site, edit them and even remove them. Allow users to locate individual recipes based on specific
recipe fields. Provide results of the recipes that is easily accessible and visually pleasing for the user.

## UX DESIGN

This application gives Users the ability to browse through other peoples recipes, edit them, remove them and to add their own if they so choose.
The User will be able to see how long it takes to cook a specific recipe, what ingredients are used, the step by step guide on how to make
a specific recipe and what tags are associated with a recipe. The User will also be able to search for a specific recipe based on it's 
cuisine.
